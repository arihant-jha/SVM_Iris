Describing the dataset

Iris dataset is a dataset about petals of Iris flowers namely of the features sepal_length sepal_width	petal_length	petal_width,
with classes - setosa, versicolor, virginica. 

Why I chose this model?

So our task is basically of classification, where I am trying to classify a flower
petal into being of one these species based upon the characteristics of it's features, as it's a multi-variate classification it 
is optimal to use Suport vector machines, using which I get distinguishing boundaries between the different species, based
upon the features. Thus I got about 95% accuracy at the end.
